2 PHP Classes for working with and managing GNIP's Power Track solution.

*** GnipPowerTrack_ManageRules ***
For managing the Gnip Rules. After including the file containing the class, start the calls with:
$gptr = new GnipPowerTrack_ManageRules('YOUR_GNIP_USERNAME', 'YOUR_GNIP_PASSWORD');

USAGE:

* Adding Rules
(bool) = $gptr->add(array(array('value'=>'item', 'Search'))))

* Deleting Rules
(bool) = $gptr->delete(array(array('value'=>'item'))))


*** GnipPowerTrack_Consume ***
For consuming tweets from Power Track.  After including the file containing the class (and modifying it for your Gnip account), start it with:

$gptc = new GnipPowerTrack_Consume('YOUR_GNIP_USERNAME', 'YOUR_GNIP_PASSWORD');

USAGE:
$gptc->consume();


In the GnipPowerTrack_Consume class, there are two functions that you may want to customize, or overwrite with your own:

* write_log($type, $log_item)
The default write_log, writes to a file, you may want to pipe this into your own logging system

* enqueue($message)
This function accepts $message, and writes it to whatever queue system you use.  The default just writes it out to the console.
